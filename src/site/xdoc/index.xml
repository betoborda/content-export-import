    <section name="Introduction">
      <subsection name="What is Hippo Content EXIM (EXport/IMport)?">
        <p>
          This project is going to provide higher level features of Content Import and Export,
          depending on Hipo Workflow API (for higher/workflow level document management) and 
          <a href="http://hippo-pojo-bind.forge.onehippo.org/" target="_blank">Hippo JCR POJO Binding</a> library
          (for lower level JCR mappings/bindings).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while <a href="http://hippo-pojo-bind.forge.onehippo.org/" target="_blank">Hippo JCR POJO Binding</a> library
          focuses only on JCR Node level mappings and bindings and doesn't provide any Hippo Workflow level operations,
          this project aims to provide higher level, that is, Hippo Workflow level,
          Content Export/Import features.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Content Migration Task Components">
        <p>
          This project provides migration task componets which can be used in any Java application or in Groovy updater scripts
          instead of trying to provide a whole new UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are basically four content migration task interfaces for which components are provided by this project:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Interface Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Implementation(s)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>
              
            </td>
            <td>

          </tr>

          </tr>

          </tr>
